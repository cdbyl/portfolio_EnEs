## Project Overview
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .text-justify}
This map shows watercourses of Buenos Aires, which are hidden in tunnels beneath the city. On the map, some of the drainage tunnels added in recent years are highlighted:

* Vega Relief Tunnel — built to address the recurring floods in the Belgrano area.
* Maldonado Relief Tunnel — also constructed to reduce flooding along Av. Juan B. Justo.
* Cildañez Relief Tunnel — part of the Maldonado’s flow is diverted here so that the Cildañez never runs completely dry, helping prevent bad odors under the area of the Olympic Village built for the 2018 Youth Olympic Games (see picture).
