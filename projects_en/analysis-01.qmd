title: "Quality of Life Index"
description: "Applying ACUMAR’s Quality of Life Index (ICV) —which assesses well-being across housing, education, health, and environment— to the neighbor Reconquista River Basin, based on the region's strong geographic and socioeconomic similarities to the originally studied Matanza-Riachuelo basin. By replicating this methodology, this study aims to generate comparable results and utilize cartographic visualization to identify vulnerable areas, ultimately providing a strategic tool for institutions to optimize resource allocation and design targeted socio-environmental policies."
